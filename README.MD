This tutorial provides a quick introduction into Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a practical exercise. 

This course is aimed at anyone interested in NLP and will cover a basic introduction to the subject.

Thoughout the tutorial, you will be using Python programming language. First, you will learn about basic textual preprocessing techniques and important NLP tasks. Then, you will get to play with a popular NLP library spaCy and its cool visualizers. Once an introduction into NLP is completed, you will strengthen your skills by going through a practical exercise and learning how to train a simple sentiment classifier.
